# Chapter 4
The World Cup, one of the **majorest** events, held in Russia, is storming from its fans to others around.

Football is considered as No. 1 on the most popular sports **rank**. Hence, a lot of fans all over the world took **flights** to Russia to get involved in this once of every four years' celebration. There is no doubt that the Russian shows their warm **greetings** to their guests, but I'm **curious** about the **dormitories** and **canteens** provided well or not.

**In general**, many of the European and South American countries are supposed to be competitive on the match, such as: **Spain**, **Italy**, Brazil, etc. Unlike commercial matches, in the World Cup the football teams **represent** for their people and countries, and **defend against** their old teammates. However, it is said by Bai, a famous host from CCTV, that all those, related to football, should come here have been in Russia except the National Male Football Team. As far as I see, quite a few football fans feel **angry** for them, as their **losing face**'s behaviors.

The Chinese National Male Football Team members are **simply** well paid **employees** rather than soldiers on the ground. They **yawn**, play **falsely**, **truly at ease**, and sometimes **dash** but no **function**. I promised that the preceding **statements** are not **misunderstandings**.

Although the games are going on night, I still read some news the other day. One photo surprised me, that the female **Muslim adults** did not have their **cheeks** and arms covered by clothing. Another shot touched my heart that a **posture** of Messi who turned his back to the audience after match - no **frowning**, no **facial** emotions, but deeply upset for his **respectful** people and country.

After all, a few teams are still **likely to approach** the champion, included Messi's.
